The function will receive two rectangles,each with the coordinates of the lower left corner 
followed by the width and the height int[] { x, y, width, height }.

OverlappingRectangles(new int[] { 2, 1, 3, 4 }, new int[] { 3, 2, 2, 5  }) ➞ 6
OverlappingRectangles(new int[] { 2, -9, 11, 5 }, new int[] { 5, -11, 2, 9 }) ➞ 10
OverlappingRectangles(new int[] { -8, -7, 4, 7 },  new int[] { -5, -9, 4, 7 }) ➞ 5
